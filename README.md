# Scripts for Team
Actually this Script can:
- Create a Team for one apprentice, with a planner (planner need to be link manually)
- Install all modules from Microsoft Graph
- Uninstall all modules from Microsoft Graph

## Know bugs
- Sometime, Users can't change role and become Owner, probably the API
- The typo in the terminal who open can be incorrect 

## Todo
- Add the planner with the script to a new tab
- Add the Excel tab with the schedule
